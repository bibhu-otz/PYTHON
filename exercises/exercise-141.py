# Define an integer variable 'x' with the value 30.
x = 30
# Print the hexadecimal representation of 'x' with leading zeros.
# The 'format' function is used with the format specifier '02x' to format 'x' as a 2-character lowercase hexadecimal string.
# It ensures that there are leading zeros to make it 2 characters long.
print(format(x, '02x'))

# Define an integer variable 'x' with the value 4.
