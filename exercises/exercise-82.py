# Calculate the sum of the elements in the list [10, 20, 30] using the 'sum' function and store it in the variable 's'
s = sum([10, 20, 30])

# Print a message indicating the sum of the container and display the value of 's'
print("\nSum of the container: ", s)

# Print an empty line for better readability
